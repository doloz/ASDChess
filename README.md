# ASDChess
ASDChess lets you develop your own iOS chess app in Swift in no time.

## Current features
* `struct`s and `enum`s for such common abstractions as piece, board cell, chess field, move and so on.
* `struct ASDPosition` allows you to perform moves and check their possibility without worrying about such things as castling and tricky pawn moves.

## Possible future features
* Built-in subclass of `UIView` which will let you to add chess in your app as easy as you can add map or browser.
* Support for timers
* Support for undoing moves
* Some decent chess engine
* Good unit test coverage
